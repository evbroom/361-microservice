{"greetings": ["Hanging out with you is always a blast and even more so on your birthday! So, let's go out and make your birthday special!", "You've been my own personal cheer leader, my therapist, and my voice of reason. But most importantly, you are my best friend. Happy birthday. You are amazing!", "When I think back to all the things we've been through, I'm so thankful that I got to go through everything with you by my side. Happy birthday to my best friend who never let me go it alone.", "Whenever you feel down or think just can't do something, just imagine me giving you a gigantic high five with a ridiculous look on my face. That should help. In the meantime though, happy birthday!", "I love it when it's your birthday, because it means we have a great excuse to go out and have some fun! Let's go celebrate!"]}
